# AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning - Learning Repository

Welcome to my learning repository for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)! This repository contains all the experiments, notes, resources, and code I create while learning these fields. My goal is to build a solid understanding of the principles and applications of AI, ML, and DL.

## Introduction

This repository is a personal collection of learning material and hands-on practice for AI, ML, and DL. I'll be covering topics ranging from basic concepts to advanced techniques. As I progress, I'll include tutorials, code implementations, experiments, and insights gained from books, online courses, and research papers.

## Learning Objectives

- **Artificial Intelligence:** Understand the foundational concepts of AI, including search algorithms, decision-making, and problem-solving.
- **Machine Learning:** Dive deep into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Implement common algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
- **Deep Learning:** Learn and implement deep learning models using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Understand the workings of CNNs, RNNs, and GANs.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** 
  - NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
  - TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch (for deep learning)
  - Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive code)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders to keep the content clean and easily accessible:


### Folder Breakdown:
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with hands-on experiments.
    - `basic_ml/`: Basic machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, SVMs).
    - `deep_learning/`: Notebooks dedicated to deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).
    - `reinforcement_learning/`: Notebooks for RL concepts and algorithms.
    - `projects/`: Completed ML/DL projects.
    - `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities for your notebooks.
  
- **datasets/**: Store datasets you are using for practice and experiments.

- **resources/**: A collection of useful resources like books, tutorials, and papers.
    - `books/`: Links or PDF of books you're using to learn.
    - `courses/`: Links to online courses (e.g., Coursera, Udemy).
    - `papers/`: Research papers you find interesting and are using in your studies.

- **scripts/**: Python scripts for non-notebook-based projects and utilities.

## Notebooks

Here, I will document and share code for various machine learning and deep learning tasks, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Model building and training
- Evaluation and testing
- Experimentation with different architectures

Each notebook will be labeled with the topic it covers, and I will aim to provide explanations and insights throughout.
